{"name":"Graph Growth","tagline":"Growing Graphs since 2013","body":"This module will load very large graphs into a database and then grow that graph and measure important properties as it grows, with the option to grow a number of different random graph alongside it for comparison.\r\n\r\nYou have the option to draw the graphs as they grow, or plot the graph measurements as the graphs grow.\r\n\r\nIt is written in Python. It uses py2neo and neo4j to store the graph as a database, allowing for very large graphs. All functions were written by Maxwell Bertolero(2013), except for the Bayes Network Toolbox stuff, which is run via Octave and oct2py. \r\n\r\nAll of the functions and dependencies can be set up with one line, in the grow directory:\r\n$ python setup.py install  \r\n\r\nPlease see the tutorials folder for the IPython notebook tutorial.
