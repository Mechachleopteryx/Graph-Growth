        <p>This module will load very large graphs into a database and then grow that graph and measure important properties as it grows, with the option to grow a number of different random graph alongside it for comparison.</p>

<p>You have the option to draw the graphs as they grow, or plot the graph measurements as the graphs grow.</p>

<p>It is written in Python. It uses py2neo and neo4j to store the graph as a database, allowing for very large graphs. All functions were written by Maxwell Bertolero(2013), except for the Bayes Network Toolbox stuff, which is run via Octave and oct2py. </p>

<p>All of the functions and dependencies can be set up with one line, in the grow directory:
$ python setup.py install  </p>

<p>Please see the tutorials folder for the IPython notebook tutorial.  </p>
