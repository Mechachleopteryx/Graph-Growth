This is an open source version of the Bayes Network Toolbox, with the ability to growth a graph and measure graph properties as the graph grows. 

It is dependent on Octave and written in Python. 

It uses py2neo and neo4j to store the graph as a database, allowing for very large graphs.

All functions were written by Maxwell Bertolero(2013), except for the Bayes Network Toolbox stuff. 

Please see the IPython notebook for a rundown and tutorial.
